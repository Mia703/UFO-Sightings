# UFO-Sightings
## Overview
Data visualisation has emerged as an indispensable element in user experience and design. Serving as a conduit for designers to effectively present data in a manner that's both easily comprehensible and visually engaging, enhacing understanding and interaction for viewers. Within a team, I was tasked with presenting a piece of data in a persuasive manner. My specific role in this project was to craft a compelling visual representation. Opting to use the [UFO dataset from CORGIS](https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/ufo_sightings/), I devised a method to not only make the data visually stimulating but also convey a clear message.
